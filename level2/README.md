how to access to directory named "-" ?

if we just put this mark on bash, some error comes out

cuz it is some kind of convention implented by many programs

it can be seen as remove file command like remove -- - and generally any file beginning of "-" it can be option command.

so it's not illegal act but standard optional character in linux

then we have to classify absolute route of "-" file

    cat ./-
    
DONE
